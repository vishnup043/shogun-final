          <p className="text-grey 2xl:text-2xl text-lg"> in his pursuit to achieve stable, large-scale cultivation of the rare wild black maitake mushrooms through artificial means, he founded yukiguni maitake in 1983. back then, maitake was rare and expensive, selling at prices as high as $250 per kilogram. but <b>Mr. Odaira</b> had a larger vision; he wanted to make maitake accessible to the wider society.</p>
          <p className="text-grey 2xl:text-2xl text-lg">Through innovation and dedication, he developed indigenous techniques to grow high-quality maitake at a much lower cost. his ambitious efforts led to extraordinary growth. the company expanded its production facilities to 4.2 million square feet, eventually catering to 70% of the maitake demand in the japanese market.</p>
